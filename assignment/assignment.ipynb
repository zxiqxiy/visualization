    "**Q1.** This question provides some practice doing exploratory data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"relevant\" variables for this question are:\n",
    "  - `level` - Level of institution (4-year, 2-year)\n",
    "  - `aid_value` - The average amount of student aid going to undergraduate recipients\n",
    "  - `control` - Public, Private not-for-profit, Private for-profit\n",
    "  - `grad_100_value` - percentage of first-time, full-time, degree-seeking undergraduates who complete a degree or certificate program within 100 percent of expected time (bachelor's-seeking group at 4-year institutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the `./data/college_completion.csv` data with Pandas.\n",
    "2. What are are the dimensions of the data? How many observations are there? What are the variables included? Use `.head()` to examine the first few rows of data.\n",
    "3. Cross tabulate `control` and `level`. Describe the patterns you see.\n",
    "4. For `grad_100_value`, create a histogram, kernel density plot, boxplot, and statistical description.\n",
    "5. For `grad_100_value`, create a grouped kernel density plot by `control` and by `level`. Describe what you see. Use `groupby` and `.describe` to make grouped calculations of statistical descriptions of `grad_100_value` by `level` and `control`. Which institutions appear to have the best graduation rates?\n",
    "6. Create a new variable, `df['levelXcontrol']=df['level']+', '+df['control']` that interacts level and control. Make a grouped kernel density plot. Which institutions appear to have the best graduation rates?\n",
    "7. Make a kernel density plot of `aid_value`. Now group your graph by `level` and `control`. What explains the shape of the graph? Use `groupby` and `.describe` to make grouped calculations of statistical descriptions of `aid_value` by `level` and `control`.\n",
    "8. Make a scatterplot of `grad_100_value` by `aid_value`. Describe what you see. Now make the same plot, grouping by `level` and then `control`. Describe what you see. For which kinds of institutions does aid seem to increase graduation rates?"

    "\n",
    "  1. Load the `./data/airbnb_hw.csv` data with Pandas. You should have cleaned the `Price` variable in question 2, and you'll need it later for this question.\n",

    "  4. For `Price`, make a histogram, kernel density, box plot, and a statistical description of the variable. Are the data badly scaled? Are there many outliers? Use `log` to transform price into a new variable, `price_log`, and take these steps again.\n",
    "  5. Make a scatterplot of `price_log` and `Beds`. Describe what you see. Use `.groupby()` to compute a desciption of `Price` conditional on/grouped by the number of beds. Describe any patterns you see in the average price and standard deviation in prices.\n",
    "  6. Make a scatterplot of `price_log` and `Beds`, but color the graph by `Room Type` and `Property Type`. What patterns do you see? Compute a description of `Price` conditional on `Room Type` and `Property Type`. Which Room Type and Property Type have the highest prices on average? Which have the highest standard deviation? Does the mean or median appear to be a more reliable estimate of central tendency, and explain why?\n",
    "  7. We've looked a bit at this `price_log` and `Beds` scatterplot. Use seaborn to make a `jointplot` with `kind=hex`. Where are the data actually distributed? How does it affect the way you think about the plots in 5 and 6?"
